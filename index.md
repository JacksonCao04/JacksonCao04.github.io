### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
I really enjoyed Lab 1 as it was a great start to C++, giving an easy transition from my previous experience with Java. The simplicity of the  "Hello World" program made the initial coding experience simple, and it played an important part in familiarizing  my knowledge with C++. Beyond the obvious simplicity, the practice proved to be an important step in learning the language.

* Lab 4 
Lab 4 was a good experience that introduced me to if statements and else if in C++. An interesting effort was the Hi-Lo game, which introduced a fun aspect to the learning process. I struggled to understand the unit's functions but me and my partner worked through it. Understanding conditional statements became simple, laying the groundwork for more complex concepts. As I advanced, my confidence in dealing with conditional logic expanded, preparing me for future obstacles. I'm looking forward to putting these abilities to use in the following labs and expanding my C++ knowledge after coding that lab!

* Lab 11
Although being difficult, Lab 11 really increased my understanding of C++ classes. Part 1 was a significant learning experience that increased my interest in coding, despite its difficulties. Part 2, which focused on object programming, was made simpler by working with my partner. Overall, Lab 11 gave an understanding to complex programming principles, building a deeper love of coding of C++ for me.
